\section{Thesis}
{\textbf{Title:} \emph{A Hierarchical Control Architecture for Robust and Adaptive Robot Control \\ \textbf{Abstract:}}}
{The architecture 1) provides an efficient, compact encoding of tasks with multiple paths of execution, 2) uses the same compact representation as the controller that the robot will use to achieve its goals, 3) allows the robot to dynamically decide which execution path to follow using an activation spreading mechanism that relies on environmental conditions, and 4) provides a mechanism for robustness to changes in the environment during the task execution.}
